# image_resizer

This is a small python script I wrote for my website. 
It can resize an entire folder of images to multiple sizes.

When the script is executed it asks for a path to the folder.
Then it will create a `.resizeConfig` that you can edit with a text editor to set the sizes, the images will be resized to, as well as the exetention, that will be added to the output folder.
After that you can hit enter and the script will resize all the images for you and will put them into a seperate folder.
